# DSI-Capstone-Project

Here you can find the python code for a Kaggle competion I did in November 2015. 
More info can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales). 
I used this competition for my capstone project for the [Data Science Intensive Workshop](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science-intensive/).

The repo contains the following files:

- Capstone Project Ideas.ipynb: a notebook with some ideas for different projects (ignore)
- Capstone Project Write Up.ipynb: a write up with some data anlysis and a summary of the results of the ML model
- DataExploration.ipynb: a messy notebook where I have performed all the exploratory data analysis. 
- Functions.py: some functions (currently one) that are used in the code
- README.md: this file
- RSS_Capstone_v1.0.py: a python script that loads and cleans the data, engineers some features and parametrizes a ML model to forecast the store sales.

The results of this analysis were also summarized on a not-too-technical blog post on [medium.com](https://medium.com/@Marrocchelli82/predicting-store-sales-other-interesting-insights-73beb8401790#.dp71v9gid).
